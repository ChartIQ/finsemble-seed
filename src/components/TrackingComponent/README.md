This recipe intend to provide support for some long starting time assimilated native apps to stay alive during workspace switches.
This TrackingComponet is used to track and save the position and bound of the the app you want to stay alive during workspace switch.

# Testing
Created 5 workspaces with the following cases.
A. Spawn a "Tracking Component" and move it to top left of your main monitor
B. Spawn a "Tracking Component" and move it to bottom right of your main monitor
C. Spawn a "Tracking Component" and move it to top left of your secondary monitor
D. Spawn a "Tracking Component" and move it to bottom right of your secondary monitor
E. An empty workspace

Switch between workspaces and observe the location of Notepad is correctly positioned in correct monitor
e.g.
A -> B
B -> A
A -> C
C -> D
D -> C
C -> E i.e. Notepad will be minimised if no "TrackingComponent" exist in the workspace.
