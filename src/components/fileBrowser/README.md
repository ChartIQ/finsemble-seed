# File System Access Via a Native Service

This repo contains the HTML5 component to use to communicate with the C# windowless component that:

- Browses for folders
- Lists a folder's contents
- Writes a file to disk

See the [C# recipe](https://github.com/ChartIQ/finsemble-dotnet-seed/tree/recipes/file-system-access-via-native-service) for more information.
