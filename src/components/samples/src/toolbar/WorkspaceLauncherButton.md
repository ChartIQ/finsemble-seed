# The Workspace Launcher Button Component

This is a component built for the sample [Toolbar](README.md). It provides a way to switch to a specific Workspace. It is built using the [FinsembleButton]() (TODO: Link) control.

The click event for this component dispatches a message to the Workspace Management Menu [@TODO Link here] for switching workspaces.
